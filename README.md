# Microscopy Image Processing

## Source code

Functions in the `src/` directory are ready to use. Live Scripts in `scripts/` illustrate key concepts.

All source code in this repository is MATLAB code. There is no reason to stick with this, though, as there are plenty of image processing routines in other languages. For example, Python users can rely on NumPy and SciPy for basic operations or OpenCV for more advanced control and routines.
